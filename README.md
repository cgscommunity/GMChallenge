# GMChallenge
Student version of the monthly Game Mechanic Challenge

## What is a Game Mechanic Challenge? 
The Game Mechanic Challenges will be a chance for you to put your knowledge of C++ and UE5 to the test! Every couple of weeks, we will post a mechanic we would like to see you attempt to complete. We will add any relevant assets required to complete the task.
Every challenge will have a new goal. How you approach that goal is up to you! Keep in mind, don’t take the example video as the law on how it should look in the end. As long as the base mechanic requirements are there, you can add to it or adapt it in any way you like! Be creative and push yourself!
## Why should I participate? 
While these challenges are voluntary, we highly encourage as many students to participate as possible! They will be a way for you to practice the skills you’re learning in class, but also a way to build up a portfolio of a variety of mechanics that might not be covered in the main course. These challenges also simulate the day to day tasks of being a videogame programmer in the industry. You will often receive a list of mechanics and it will be your job to make them happen.
## How long will I have to complete each challenge? 
While every challenge is subject to different time frames, on average students will be given two weeks to complete each challenge. We want you to have plenty of time to tackle the task presented to you and find ways to add a little extra flare to it, if you so choose.
## How will I submit my challenge? 
Record a video play through of your challenge and post it on the #general_programming channel by the due date if possible but dont be afraid to share later either. Don't forget to share your progress along the way!

For instructions and helpful tips on the challenges, see their respective README_ChallengeName file. We are very excited to see what you all create with these challenges! For each challenge we encourage you to share your progress in this channel. Lean on your mentors, myself, and fellow students for questions and support! If you have any questions about the challenge requirements or general questions, feel free to reach out to @Pace Abbott.
