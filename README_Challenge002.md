# Snow Toss
Snow Toss! Our Winter themed game. Using the provided scene, you will be creating a projectile/shooter based game. Targets should pop up out of the present boxes, and our Hero needs to hit them with a snowball!

**DISCLAIMER**: The assets provided in this project are for personal use only. **DO NOT** use them in your commercial projects unless you have purchased them yourself from the Unreal Marketplace.
## Required Mechanics:
* A clear indication that the game has started and that the player can now fire snowballs
* Targets for the player to hit
* visual feedback to show a successful hit
* Players can be limited via a timer or a number of targets that appears, but there must be a end game
* End of match screen that shows the results(stats up to you, hits/misses or different target types have different scoring values)

## Bonus Examples:
Be creative! As long as the above Required Mechanics are met, we encourage you to add to them/adapt them in any way you like! Here are some examples of things that can be done:
* Audio triggers when targets are hit
* Variety of targets(sizes/speeds)
* Keep track of a hit streak and reward the player with a bigger/faster snowball?
* Stamina that decreases projectile speed
* Higer score for faster hit( time on screen for targets effects score)

## Due Date:
You will have three weeks to complete this challenge. All challenges must be submitted by **Monday, December 20th**.
